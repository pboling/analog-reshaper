Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/pboling/anonymous_active_record. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the AnonymousActiveRecord project’s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/pboling/anonymous_active_record/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically,
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will
only be introduced with new major versions.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a
dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example in a `Gemfile`:

    gem 'analog-reshaper', '~> 1.0', group: :test

or in a `gemspec`

    spec.add_development_dependency 'analog-reshaper', '~> 1.0'
